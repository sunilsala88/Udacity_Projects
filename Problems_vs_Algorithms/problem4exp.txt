Data structure:
Linear-time partition routine is used to sort the array that separated the values into three groups.

values less than the pivot
values equal to the pivot
values greater than pivot

Implementation process

For this dutch national flag problem, I just copied the solution from the "lesson 2: sorting algorithms". And I add some extra checking. For example, if the length of the input list 
is empty, then it returns -1. If there is any number other than 0s, 1s, or 2s, then returns -1. There are four different
conditions in the IF statement. This is a single traversal by putting all possible 0 at the start of the array, all 2s in the end, and the 1s in the middle of array.


Time Complexity:
The code traverses through the length of the array and compare the numbers and does swapping when necessary. Hence the time complexity O(length of the array):O(n)

Space Complexity:
Space complexity is O(1).
