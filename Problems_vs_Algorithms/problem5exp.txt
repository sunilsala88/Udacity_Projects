In class Trie, initializing this Trie by adding a root node from the class TrieNode, then adding words to the Trie by applying a for loop. 
In the search function, I also use a for loop to find the Trie node that represents this prefix.

In the class TrieNode, initializing this node in the Trie, checking if the node represent the end of the word. In the suffixes function,create a array list, recursing the suffix function, and returning the list. In the suffix function

Time complexity - O(1) 
Space complexity - O(1) 
Suffix of a node: Time complexity: O(mh) Space complexity: O(mh) where m is maximum number of elements in one level and h is the height.
