Data Structures & Algorithms Udacity Nanodegree Program projects

 - Project 1 - Unscramble computer science problem:
Project contains solution for 5 short tasks and time complexity analysis of them.

 - Project 2 - Show me the data structures:
Project contains solutions for six questions which covers topics related to different data structures like linked lists, trees. It also contains also time and space analysis for all questions.

 - Project 3 - Problems vs Algorithms:
Project contains solutions for seven questions which covers topics related to the basic algorithms, like binary search, merge sort. It also contains also time and space analysis for all questions.

 - Route planer:
The aim of the route planner was to implement A* algorithm to calculate and find the shortest path between two points on a map.
