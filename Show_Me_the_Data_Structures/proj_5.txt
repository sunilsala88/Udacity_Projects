In this project we are creating block chain by using linkedlist.
we are creating unique id for each data by using hashlib library which generate unique id
If we change any data then the next data will also change due to which all the blocks are modified



Blockchain uses an extended node class, which stores: a real-time timestamp, a data field, a previous hash code, a reference to the previous block, and a SHA-256 hash code of the data field. These are the required fields to full fill the



Aside from the constructor, the class BlockChain implements: append(), size(), and to _list() methods. These were adapted from Udacityâ€™s LinkList class, as the project noted a BlockChain is similar to a linked list. These seemed like the minimal methods needed to build a basic BlockChain. The time and space complexities are O(n) for size() and to_list(), while append() is O(1).
