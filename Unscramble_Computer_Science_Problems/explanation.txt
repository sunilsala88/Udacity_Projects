task0:->

Explanation:
 In both line of print function, as I am accessing the elements from list using indexing
This runs in __O(1)__, due to the fact that _access_ on a Python array has O(1), and there are
two lines executing accesses to lists
	
time complexity= O(1) + O(1) = O(2) =O(1) i.e constant




task1:->

This takes runs in __O(n)__, due to the fact that we access sequentially both files for two of their
columns, resulting in 

Time complexity (worst case): O(n)

task2:->

we have two for loop 
first runs for n time 
second for loop runs for 2 time 
Therefor time complexity of the solution is O(n*2)i.e O(n)

task3:->

1st loop for calls -> O(n)
2md loop among calls (worst case all calls again) -> O(n)
1 sorted function -> O(nlogn)
1 loop among calls (worst case all calls again) -> O(n)
Total = O(n+n + nlogn + n)  -> O(nlogn)

task4:->

for texters -> O(n) 
for call_receivers -> O(n) 
for marketers -> O(n) 
The sorted function at the end -> O(nlogn) 

time complexity=O(n + n + n + nlogn) -> O(nlogn)
